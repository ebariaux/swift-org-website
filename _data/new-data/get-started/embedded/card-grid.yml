paragraph:
  Embedded Swift is not limited to specific hardware devices or platforms. It's versatile, it can be integrated with
  existing SDKs and build systems, and it can also be used for pure baremetal development. Most commonly used ARM
  and RISC-V chips can be targeted by the Swift toolchain.
